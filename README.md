# A-Guide-to-Learning-ROS-Navigation-and-TutleBots
Inside this repository will a series of guides, logs and code. This should help an absolute beginner learn how to use a TurtleBot in conjunction with ROS navigation. 


# Introduction:

The purpose of this repository is to cover my journey in learning to use ROS navigation. At the time of creating this repository, I am a computer science student in their final year of study. My primary coding language is C++, but I will be learning Python along the way, since this is the programming language I will be using to complete this project. Why am I loggging my findings and writting instructions for someone to potentially follow? I am doing an Independent Study titled "Introduction to using neuroscience concepts to inspire state-of-the-art algorithms for robotics" this semester, and we figured this would be an excellent way to show what I've learned.

Note: I'm going to try and give my own tutorial for everything I do (ex. Installing Linux alongside windows), but I will give a link to any pages that helped me get there.

## Baseline Knowledge:

I think its important for anyone who will read this to understand what I know going into this, that way they might be able to get into my frame of mind.

1. I have codded in C++ (specifically C++ 11) for 99% of my coding career.
2. I am a native Windows user. I'm quite frankly bad at using Linux (which is required in order fot his to all work), specifically the command line.
3. I have messed around with ROS a little bit, I took a class titled "Introduction to Robotics", in which I built a robotic arm in simulation. The link to a guide that helped me achieve this is here: [WS MoveIt and Panda Arm](https://ros-planning.github.io/moveit_tutorials/).

## What I hope to learn from this:
 
 1. A much more robust knowledge in both Python and Linux, especially using the command line.
 2. Implementing ROS.
 3. The Python Language.
 4. Anything else that may come up as this goes along.
