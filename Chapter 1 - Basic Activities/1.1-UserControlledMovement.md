So the first Thing i wanted to start working on was some basic movement of the TurtleBot. After connecting to the TurtleBot like in [Chapter0, Step5](linktosection), I followed ROS's tutorial (which is more of a "run this command, and figure it out" tutorial) on how a user can control the TurtleBot. The first thing that I tried was to use the [keyboardTeleop](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot_teleop/Tutorials/indigo/Keyboard%20Teleop) tutorial. Its essentually just using a one line command, and pressing buttons on your keyboard to get it to move around. Super easy to do, and easy enough to use. I did, however, find it a little odd to use (maybe because for 70% of my life I've played video games on a controller). Having 6 keys for directional inputs, and a few more keys to control speed, just felt a little klunky. So my next plan of action will be to use a joy stick (ie. controller) to control it. There's only one issue however, TurtleBot explicitly only works with a PS3 controller, and I have a Nintendo Switch controller. Howver, this is a good because then I'll be able to outline what I did, so hopefully, you should be able to use any controller (with a joystick) to control the TurtleBot

Here's how I did it:
