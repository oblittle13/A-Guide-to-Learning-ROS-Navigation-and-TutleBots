Now let's have a look at what the camera on the TurtleBot actually sees. (Note: most likely this will be shown to you at approxiamtley 2 frames per second, so its no iPhone camera.)

1. Get 3 terminals running that are SSHed into your turtlebot laptop.
2. On the first window, get the TrutleBot into bringup minimal (see previous section).
3. On the second window, we want to start the 3D sensor. (Make sure it's not plugged into a USB 3.0 port - usually blue). Then run this command `roslaunch turtlebot_bringup 3dsensor.launch`
4. On the final window, we want to launch rviz (a virtualization tool). For us, this means running the command `roslaunch turtlebot_rviz_launchers view_robot.launch`
   - This will take a few seconds to start up. 
   - When RViz is opened, on the right hand side you'll see a selection of "displays". You can check and uncheck these boxes to "see what your robot sees". You may need to rotate the view to see anything. If you want a good picture, check the boxes "Lazer Scan" and "Registered Depth-Cloud"
